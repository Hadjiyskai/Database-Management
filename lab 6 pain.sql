/* An outer join basically is used to show all values within two or more tables that are being joined. This is different fro the inner join, which only returns matching values between the two tables. Left and right outer joins only differ based on which table is being referenced first. A left outer join will reference the first table (table 1) while a right outer join will reference the second table (table 2).

Example of a left outer join:
SELECT orders.aid, agents.name
FROM orders
LEFT OUTER JOIN agents
ON orders.aid = agents.aid;

Example of a right outer join:
SELECT orders.cid, customers.city
FROM orders
RIGHT OUTER JOIN customers
ON customers.cid = orders.cid;
